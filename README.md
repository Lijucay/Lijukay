# About me:

Hello, I am Lijukay.
I am an 18 year old student at a highschool in Germany.
I love languages, especially English and French (although I have probelems with vocabulary and grammar in both).
Also I have a big love to Google's Material 3 theme and to quotable stuff.
I am learning constantly by watching videos and asking developers for help.

Feel free to have a look at my code, if you are interested in chaotic writing :D

# Contact:
